# warfarin-machinelearning
Machine Learning for Prediction of Stable Warfarin Dose in US Latinos and Latin Americans


*01- Reproduces IWPC cohort (n = 5051) and creates a table of subject characteristics similar to Table 1 in Klein et. al 2009. *

*02 - Predict warfarin dose in IWPC cohort*

*03 - Create the Merged dataset and ULLA by doing so *

* 04 - Predict warfarin dose in Merged cohort *

* 05 - predict warfarin dose in ULLA cohort *

06 - Failed attempt to reproduce Liu et. al 2017. 

07 - Create Merged dataset with alternative imputation strategy 

08 - Create Table 1 for the manuscript

09 - Not included (Failed Figure 2) 

10 - Create Complete cases only dataset

11 - Predict warfarini dose in Complete Case cohort

12 - same as 05 with a by race component in the results

Thank you so much for taking the time to view this code.
